# US Wildfire Analytics
## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION  
With changes in atmospheric conditions due to anthropogenic (i.e. human made) emissions, the occurrence, frequency and magnitude of wildfires has increased over the last two decades. Also human shelters are increasingly developed in more fire prone areas resulting increased hazards and costs.  

New methods and technologies are required to contain and suppress the wildfires.  

To develop these new methods a better understanding of the geographic location, size, progression is required.  

The purpose of this project is to develop a Dashboard with analytics to provide statistics of wildfire. Emphasis is on the progression of the size of the fire over time and the use of aerial fire fighting (if any to contain and/or suppress the fire). 

Create two models.
